## Slug Bug
Slug Bug is a "game" one plays with a friend while in a car. The object of the game is to be the first to see any and all Volkswagen Bugs that are on the road or parked. 
If a player sees a Bug they are to call out "slug bug *color of the Bug*" and if they are the first to call out that particular Bug, they are awarded a slug on the other player. 
Slug = a punch on the arm/shoulder. 

I have been playing this game with my friend for the past 2 odd years and I believe the score is around 200ish to 0 (you can guess who has the score of 0 based on who is going to dedicate a 
bunch of time to making a ML model to quickly recognize Bugs). 

The goal of this project is to train the YOLO v.(I don't know yet) model to classify/detect Volkswagen Bugs and only Volkswagen Bugs. 
After which I will be taping my webcam to my dash and bringing my laptop with me to see how it compares to my friend's uncanny ability to find small German made cars on the road.
